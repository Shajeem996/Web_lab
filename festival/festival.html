(The corresponding dates in the Gregorian calendar usually fall in late October and November.)

It is a cultural celebration that gives Hindus and non-Hindus alike an opportunity to have fun and play with other people by throwing coloured water and powder at each other. It is also observed broadly on the Indian subcontinent.</p>
